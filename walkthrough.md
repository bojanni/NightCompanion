- Findings: Settings page for OpenRouter credentials is implemented and wired into sidebar/app navigation.
- Conclusions: Credential storage and retrieval are available through Electron IPC (`settings:getOpenRouter`, `settings:saveOpenRouter`) and consumed by renderer settings form.
- Actions: Verified the relevant files and wiring (`src/screens/Settings.tsx`, `src/App.tsx`, `src/components/Sidebar.tsx`, `electron/preload.ts`, `electron/main.ts`).
