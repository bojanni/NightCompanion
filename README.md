# NightCompanion

Purpose
NightCafe Companion is a powerful desktop application designed for AI art creators who use NightCafe AI. It serves as your complete workflow management hub, helping you organize prompts, track results, analyze what works, and continuously improve your AI art generation process. Whether you're a hobbyist exploring AI art or a professional managing large creative projects, NightCafe Companion streamlines your entire creative pipeline.
What It Does
NightCafe Companion transforms the scattered process of AI art creation into an organized, data-driven workflow. Instead of losing track of successful prompts or manually testing different models, you get a centralized system that remembers everything, learns from your style, and helps you make better creative decisions.
